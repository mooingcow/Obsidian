# 01 Intro to Forensics
---

## Overview
---
- digital forensics
    - application of computer science and investigative procedures for legal purposes
    - involves the analysis of digital evidence:
	    - after proper search authority 
	    - chain of custody
	    - validation with math
	    - use of validated tools
	    - repeatability
	    - reporting 
	    - possible expert presentation
- history
    - Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) created to ensure consistency in federal proceedings
    - FBI computer analysis and response team (CART)
        - 1984
        - handle cases with digital evidence
        - by late 1990s, cart teamed up w department of def comp forensics lab (DCFL)
    - 4th amendment of US constitution protects our rights to be secure from search and seizure
        - goal to protect right to privacy and unreasonable intrusions from govt


## Case Law
---
- current laws cannot keep up with rate of tech change
- when statutes (law passed by legislative body) dont exist, **case law** used
    - allow legal counsel to apply prev similar cases to current case to address ambiguity in laws
- examiners must know recent court rulings on search & seizure in electronic environment

## Developing Digital Forensics Resources
---
- supplement knowledge by
    - developing and maintaining contact with relevant investigative professionals
    - join computer user groups in public/private sectors
        - Eg. computer tech investigators network (CTIN) to discuss problems examiners encounter
    - consult other experts

## Digital Investigations
---
### Preparing an Investigation
- Role of digital forensics professional  is to gather evidence to prove that suspect commited crime or violated company policy
    - Collect evidence to offer in court/corporate inquiry
        - Investigate suspect computer
        - Preserve evidence on different computer
- Chain of Custody
    - Route evidence takes from time found until case closed/goes to court

### Public Sector Investigations
- involve govt agencies resp for criminal investigations and prosecution

###### Following Legal Processes
- criminal investigation usually begins when someone finds evidence/witness a crime
    - witness/victim make **allegation** to police
- police interview complainant and writes report
- report processed and investigation is started/info is logged into police **blotter**
    - **blotter** - historical db of prev crimes

###### Entities
- Digital Evidence First Responder (DEFR)
    - 1st at incident scene
    - assess situation
    - take precautions to acquire and preserve evidence
- Digital Evidence Specialist (DES)
    - has skill to analyse data
    - determine when another specialist shld be called in to assist
- Affidavit
    - sworn statement of support of facts abt/evidence of crime
        - must include exhibits that support allegation


### Private Sector Investigations
- involve private companies and laywers who address company policy violations and litigation disputes
    - Eg. wrongful termination
- businesses strive to minimise/eliminate litigation from crimes such as:
    - E-mail harassment, falsification of data, gender and age discrimination, embezzlement, sabotage, and industrial espionage
- businesses reduce risk of litigation by publishing and maintaining **policies** employees can read and follow easily
    - most impt policies define rules for using company's computers and networks
        - AKA acceptable use policy
    - can avoid litigation with warning banner to inform users that organisations reserve right to inspect computer systems and network traffic at will

#### Line of Authority
- who has legal right to initiate inves. 
- who can take possession of evidence 
- who can have access to evidence

#### During a Private Investigation
- Search for evidence to support allegations of violations of company's rules/attack on its assets
    - 3 types of common situations
        - abuse/misuse of computing assets
        - email abuse
        - internet abuse
- Investigator's job is to minimise risk to company
- Distinction between personal & company computer property can be difficult
    - **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** environment
        - states that if you connect personal device to business network, it falls under same rules as company property


## Maintaining Professional Conduct
---
- professional conduct - ethics, morals and standards of behaviour
- investigators must
    - exhibit highest level of professional behaviour all times
        - objectivity
        - credibility by maintaining confidentiality
    - attend training to stay current with latest tech changes in computer hardware & software, networking and forensics tools

## Computer Crime
---
- computers contain information that helps law enforcement determine
    - chain of events leading to crime
    - evidence that can lead to conviction
- law enforcement officers should follow proper procedure when acquiring evidence
    - digital evidence can be easily altered by overeager investigator
    - info can also be password protected so need use forensics tools

## Company Policy Violation
---
- employees misuse resources can cost company millions of dollars
    - misuse includes
        - surfing internet
        - sending personal emails
        - using company comps for personal tasks


## Systematic Approach
---
- initial assessment about type of case investigating
- determine preliminary design/approach to case
- create detailed checklist
- determine resources needed
- obtain & copy evidence drive
