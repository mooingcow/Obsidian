---

## Lab Budget Planning
---
- breakdown costs into daily, quarterly and annual expenses
    - more understanding for these expenses, better delegate resources for each investigation
- use past investigation expenses to estimate future costs

###### expenses for lab
- hardware
- software
- facility space
- training personnel

###### considerations
- estimate number of computer cases your lab expects to examine
    - identify types of comp to examine
- account for changes in tech - upgrades?
- use stats to determine type of computer crimes more likely to occur
    - better estimate resources needed
    - plan ahead lab requirements and costs

- when setting up lab for priv company, check
    - hardware and software inventory
    - probs reported last year

## Certification and Training
---
- update skills through training
    - thoroughly research requirments, cost and acceptibility in area of employment
    - address minimum skills for conducting computer inves. at all levels
---
### certifications
###### international association of comp investigative specialists (IACIS)
- created by police officers who wanted to formalise creds in comp inves.
- candidates who complete IACIS test designated as **certified forensic computer examiner (CFCE)**

###### accessdata certified examiner (ACE) 
- open to pub and priv sectors
- specific to use and mastery of accessdata ultimate toolkit
- exam has knowledge based assessment (KBA) and prac skills assessment (PSA)

###### other training and certifications
- ec-council
- sysadmin, audit, network, security (SANS) institute
	- expensive
- defence cyber investigations training academy (DCITA)
---

## Physical Requirements for Lab
---
- should be secure so evidence not lost/corrupted/destroyed
    - provide safe and secure physical environment
    - secure facility should preserve integrity of data
- keep inventory control of assets
    - know what you have/dont have

- door access with locking mechanism
- secure container
- visitor's log
- ppl working together should have same access level
- brief staff about security policy
---

## Conducting High Risk Investigations
---
- high risk inves. demand more security than min lab requirements
    - TEMPEST facilities
        - electromagnetic radiation (EMR) proofed
            - leaking signal can be used to reconstruct info
        - such facilities can stop info systems from leaking through emanations
            - includes unintentional radio/electrical signals/sounds/vibrations
        - very expensive
            - can use low-emanation workstations instead
---

## Using Evidence Containers
---
- AKA evidence lockers
- must be secure so no unauthorised person can easily access your evidence

###### recommendations for securing storage containers
- locate in restricted area
- limited num of authorised people to access container
- maintain records on who is authorised to access each container

- place keys in lockable container
- same lvl of security for key as evidence container
- change locks and keys annually

- containers shld be made of steel with internal cabinet/external padlock
    - if possible acquire a **media safe**
        - designed to protect electronic media
- if possible build evidence storage room in your lab
- keep evidence log
    - update everytime evidence container opened and closed
---

## Overseeing Facility Maintenance
---
- immediately repair physical damage
- escort cleaning crews as they work where possible
- minimise risk of static electricity
    - antistatic pads

## Selecting Forensic Workstation
---
###### basic forensic workstation
- depend on budget and needs
- use less powerful workstations for mundane tasks
    - use multi-purpose workstations for resource-heavy analysis tasks

###### lab workstation
- identify environment
    - hardware platform
    - os 
- police labs have most diverse needs for computer inves. tools
    - lab may need legacy systems and software to match what's used in community
    - small, local police dept might have 1 multi-purpose pc and 1/2 general purpose pc
- can use pc with firewire, usb3, or SATA hard disks to create lightweight, mobile forensic pc
---

## Stocking Hardware Peripherals
---
###### must have
- IDE cables
- ribbon cabbles for floppy disks
- extra usb3 or newer cables and SATA cards
- SCSI cards
	- prefer ultrawide
- gpu
	- both PCI and AGP types
- assorted firewire and usb adapters
- hard disk drives
- at least 2 2.5 inch notebook ide hard drives to standard ide/ata or sata adapter
- computer hand tools
---

## Maintaining OS and Software Inventories
---
###### licensed copies (best to have)
- microsoft office
	- current and old
- quicken
	- personal finance management tool
- programming languages
	- visual basic and visual c++
